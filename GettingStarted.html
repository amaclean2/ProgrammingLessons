			<h1>Getting Started</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="page-content">
			<p>This is a course in the idea and concept of programming as a whole and the industry that uses it.
				We are going to work in Python mainly but we'll cover some concepts in HTML web development and JavaScript to get a full understanding of what you see on your screen.</p>
			<!-- <p>To get started, the lessons and files will be kept <a class="start-button" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/amaclean2/ProgrammingLessons">here</a></p> -->
			<p>Continue to follow the instructions to get started</p>
			<p>For now, these lessons are only for Mac users, I will introduce a Windows version in the future</p>

			<h2>Editors</h2>
			<p>A text editor is an application that runs on your computer that allows you to write to a file, save it, edit it, and many other things, depending on the editor. 
				A good one has a lot of functionality that can make your life a lot easier when you're trying to write code such as formatting, variable suggestions and syntax highlighting.</p>
			<p>Right now we're going to use Sublime Text which is pretty standard across developers.</p>
			<p>You can download it from <a class="start-button" href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

			<h2>Start Writing Code</h2>
			<p>We're going to start writing some code, but first we need an environment</p>
			<p>On your keyboard press<code>âŒ˜ + spaceBar</code></p>
			<p>Type in "Terminal" and press <code>return</code></p>
			<p>Type in <code>bash getStarted.sh</code></p>
